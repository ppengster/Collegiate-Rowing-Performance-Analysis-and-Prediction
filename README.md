# Collegiate-Rowing-Performance-Analysis-and-Prediction
Analyzed the workout data of a collegiate men’s rowing team and built a prediction model that estimates one’s 2000-meter test score using Linear Regression.

Cleaned, processed, and visualized the data using Pandas, Plotly, and Seaborn.

Reached 5.2 RMSE on average and found that an increase in weight has more to do with a faster 2k than a growth in height and that a fast 8k time ensures a fast 2k time.
